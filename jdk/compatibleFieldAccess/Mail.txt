Summary
-------

Actually it is not possible to remove non-private fields or limit the 
visibility of existing fields without breaking binary compatibility. Where
binary compatility is not a major issue in most application projects it
is a somewhat bigger issue in library projects and must have in APIs that
are part of the JDK. The suggested changes to the jvm allows it to remove
non-private fields or change the visibility of fields in a binary compatible way.

Non-Goals
---------

The suggested Change does not want to change to Java(The Language). It is not intended
to allow field access through accessor(get/set) methods with simple field/property access
syntax(instanceOrClass dot fieldname). It would be possible to also support one special
change to the static property of an field (from non-static to static) but this is out 
of focus. However this would also be possible in an implementation-specific way. 

Changes in visibility of fields should be possible in a binary compatible way.
This does not ensure that the changes are fully runtime compatible. And it definitivly 
breaks source compatibility in Java(The Language), other languages that run ontop of 
the jvm can implement this differently. 

Motivation
----------

This will enable the OpenJDK-Contibutors to make some changes to the APIs and
implementations that would otherwise be non binary compatible. Futhermore external
Java Library Projects can make more changes in a binary compatible way. It is not
a must have for Java Library Projects but a good investment in existing Java Software.
The only competitor i had seen are some suggestions to make changes to Java(The Language) 
to enable source-level use to accessor-methods via field/property access syntax. This JEP
does not want to change the language. Anyway a change to Java(The Language) that enables the
use of accessor-methods through field/property access syntax should also observe binary
compatibility in some way. 

Description
-----------

If you limit the visibility of an existing(older version of your implementation) field
than callsites- (independent if it is byte-code or source-code) that accesses this 
field maybe(depending of the relationship of the callsite and the changed field) no 
longer valid. You get compiler-errors for source-code and linkage-errors for byte-code.
While this maybe not a problem for API- and application-projects it is a real 
show-stopper, for limiting the visibility of existing fields, for APIs like the JDK.
While source-code compatibility is not a major case for the JDK-APIs binary-compatibility
is. (todo: search and link the article about different compatibility-levels).

Field-Access in the jvm is done via the GETSTATIC(0xB2),PUTSTATIC(0xB3),GETFIELD(0xB4),
PUTFIELD(0xB5) bytecodes. This byte-codes are more or less simple (with some visibility
checks) accesses to fields(static of instance-level). If there is a field access through
these byte-codes and the field to access in not visibile for the call-site you get linkage
errors. If you use the static variants to access an non-static field and vice-versa you
UncompatibleClassChangeErrors. Primary we want to get a solution to the linkage error
case(change in visibity). This should be solved in thie following way:

If there is a field access, static or non-static, and the callsite cannot access it (wherever
it is not visible or non-existing) the linker searches for methods (with the same static/
non-static property) that gives access to this field and is visible to the callsite.
The field should be marked with an annotation (ex. java/lang/Accessor). The Accessor-Annoation
has a property value that contains the name of the supported field. The matching method for
PUTSTATIC and PUTFIELD has one single Parameter which in compatible to the expexted fieldtype.
The returntype for this method must be void. The matching method for GETSTATIC and GETFIELD 
has no parameter and an returnvaluetype which is compatible to the expected fieldtype.

If there are multiple methods that matches the requirement the method with the laest visiblity
is choosen. If there are multiple methods with the same visibility an uneindeutige accessor
error is thrown while verifying the class that contains the uneideutigen accessor-methods. 
However this situation should be checked at compiletime of the class with the uneindeutigen
field access-methods.



Signed-Code / Security-Related-Code
Maybe the suggested change to the bytecode semantics should not be applied
to signed code that is compiled for a jvm version prior to the suggested change.
Lets say JVM(0) is the version which comes with the changed bytecode semantics.
And JVM(<0) are versions before that and JVM(>0) are versions after JVM(0).
Than maybe the suggested changes to the bytecode semantics should not be applied
to siged code that is compiled for JVM(<0). Some implementors of security related
implementations or signed code what to turn of this compatibility function even
if they compile against JVM(>0), so this feature should be turned of in some way.
It is possible to turn of this compatible-mode in varios levels from instruction
to jar/(jigsaw-module). 
 - Annotation (instruction/method/class)
 - MANIFEST (jar/jigsaw-module)

// REQUIRED -- Describe the enhancement in detail: Both what it is and,
// to the extent understood, how you intend to implement it.  Summarize,
// at a high level, all of the interfaces you expect to modify or extend,
// including Java APIs, command-line switches, library/JVM interfaces,
// and file formats.  Explain how failures in applications using this
// enhancement will be diagnosed, both during development and in
// production.  Describe any open design issues.

// This section will evolve over time as the work progresses, ultimately

// Include hyperlinks to additional documents as required.

Alternatives
------------

I had implemented a very small concept-prototype with bytecode-manipulation 
through the PreMain-Hook. We can simply transform all loaded classes to use
lasy linkage through invokedynamic for field accesses. The implementation level
impact would be much smaller, but i think the runtime costs would be to 
high for this approach. We could limit lasy linkage(invokedynamic) for
field access only for fields that are not visible/accessible at classload 
time(ex. the target class is not loaded yet), leave accessible field as
they are and change field access that are not directly accesible but are
accessible through access-methods to calling the access methods. 

We could also handle every field access as an call to an accessor-method
in first place and only if there is a field that is directly accessible
from the callsite change this to direct field access. This solution has 
an even bigger performance cost, because field access to private fields 
is naturally much more common.

One other problem i see with bytecode transformation is signed/sealed 
code. I don't think that this code should be changed. But maybe it is
prefareable for signed/seald not to change the bytecode semantics as well. 

Testing
-------

Performance
Security (for signed code)
// What kinds of test development and execution will be required in order
// to validate this enhancement, beyond the usual mandatory unit tests?
// Be sure to list any special platform or hardware requirements.

Risks and Assumptions
---------------------

The linkage process is slightly more complicated that it is today. So the
startup-time for cases that uses the compatiblity layer for field access
will startup more slowly.
The semantic of an long existing bytecode would be changed with an somewhat 
more dificult/diffuse meaning. 
Simple (in some way statically linked) field accesses are replaced with method
calls with implicit semantics and possible exception occurance that can
surpress other (security related) exceptions.
Library Project that uses the new compatiblity field access can effect existing
applications in new ways. The simple fast access to a simple field is replaced
throught a method call which can be (depending of the code inside the method) 
somewhat slower. If the field has some concurrency carateristics this can even 
result in new concurrency problems that are hard to find.
Applications Projects that are implicity using the new compatiblity field access
can run into some realy late(production) runtime exceptions where the binary
imcompatible change to the field would had resulted in an early (test-stage/startup)
linkage error.
